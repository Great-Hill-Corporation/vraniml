The project files for this library were created
with MSVC version 5.0.  If you have another compiler
you may have to create your own project files.

You can build all parts of this library by opening the
file vrutils.dsw in your IDE.

First build the image library (free software available
from Colosseum Builders C++ Image Library 
<info@colosseumbuilders.com>).

Next build the vrutils.lib and vrutils.dll files (note:
these are called vrutilsd.lib and vrutilsd.dll when
built _DEBUG mode).

Next build the example.exe file.

Debugging through the example.exe file will show
you how each and every C++ class included in
the library works.

Have fun.  Please send us a note if you find this
