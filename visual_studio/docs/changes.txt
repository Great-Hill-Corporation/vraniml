Changes for Beta version 0.9.03
12/14/98
=========================================================
Most of the changes in this release of
VRaniML involve upgrading and fixing
the VRML 2.0 parser.  These changes
should be transparent.

Also, a lot of code was extracted out into
a new .dll and .lib file called vrutils.lib.
This library contains the basic classes including
vector, matrix, container, and base node classes
used by the vraniml.lib.  The source code for this
library is now made freely available.

Also, the previous image file format library was
replaced with a freely available library called
imglib.lib.  There are a few bugs remaining in
this code so textures are kind of messed up but
some formats (i.e. JPEG) should work OK.

Also, the SFString class (which in previous versions
was just a #define for a char*) has been replaced
with full fledged String class.  This is the
only change that we know of that will have an
effect on already existing source code.  You should
carefully search for any occurances of SFString in
your existing application source code and replace
it with char*.  Then re-build the application with
the new definition of SFString.

Finally, some function and variable names have
changed. These are all documented in the file
OldNames.h which you can include by #defining
VR_INCLUDE_OLD_NAMES before including vraniml.h.
