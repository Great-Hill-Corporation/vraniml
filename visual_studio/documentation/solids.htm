<p>The basis of all VRaniML's geometry nodes is a data structure called the HalfEdge.
&nbsp; This data structure allows us to support a wide range of 3D graphics algorithms
such as boolean operations, mesh decimation, etc.&nbsp; Because this data structure is so
fundamental to VRaniML, and of such a proprietary nature, we withhold its documentation
from the downloadable version of the SDK.</p>

<p>Upon purchase of a source code license you will receive the documentation for this
collection of classes.&nbsp; The documentation available here is of limited use.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is absolutely no need for you to understand how these class work to use
the SDK fully.&nbsp; The existence of the halfedge data structure is completely hidden
from the user.</p>
