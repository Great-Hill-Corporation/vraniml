&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reference Manuals</h1>

<p>VRaniML contains three separate C++ class libraries.&nbsp; Two of these libraries
provide implementations for basic 3D related operations (such as vector and matrix math)
and a fundamental geometric data structure (called the <em>half edge</em>).&nbsp; The
third library (the VRML97 Class Library) implements most of the functionality defined in
the VRML97 spec.</p>

<p>Each class library is documented in a separate reference manual.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This collection of C++ classes implements each of the VRML97 nodes, allows for the
  reading and writing of VRML97 compliant files, implements the runtime environment as
  defined in VRML97 as well as implementing a number of other VRML related concepts.&nbsp;
  The library is based on the Utility and Solid Modeling Libraries below.</p>

<p><a href="../Documentation/solids.htm"><strong>Solid Modeling Library</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Solid Modeling Library implements the internal data representation for all geometry
  related nodes.&nbsp; The use of this data structure (the <em>half edge</em>) allows us to
  anticipate useful algorithms such as mesh decimation and boolean operations for future
  versions of VRaniML.&nbsp; This library is also stand-alone and may be used for any
  purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="../Documentation/utility.htm"><strong>Utility Class Library</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A collection of classes implementing functionality such as debugging support, time
  management, file reading and fetching over the network, etc.&nbsp; Collection classes such
  as lists and arrays as well as basic geometry data types such as matrix and vector classes
  are also supported.&nbsp; This library may be used stand-alone.</p>
